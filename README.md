# cs105-prj-phase1-square

## Objective
This is our project on climate change trends. We want to analyze and see if there is a correlation between general weather tends over various areas, and what current meterologists and global warming experts are saying.

## Phase 1 

### Extracted Data 

We decided to use Scrapy, a versatile web scraper useful with the framework for Python to help retrieve the data needed. 

The first dataset we want to crawl using Scrapy is the "Climate Change: Earth Surfact Temperature Data" from the years 1750 - 2015. There is more than enough data in this dataset, and includes attributes such as date, average temperature, country, etc. There are multiple .csv files on this page, but we plan to use (at least for now) the Global Land Temperatures By Country file.
